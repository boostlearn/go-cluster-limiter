## The difference with other limiters
     
the local host limiter mainly controls the use of local traffic, 
which can be implemented using algorithms such as counters, leaky buckets, or token buckets,
does not depend on the external environment and needs low resource consumption.

However, the algorithm which used in local host limiter cannot run in the cluster's service partition mode. 
The common method is to control the cluster's flow by calling the external flow control (RPC) service. 
however, cluster limiter carried out through the network, requires high network stability, consume certain request time delay, 
easily forms a single hot spot, and consumes a lot of resources, limits its scope of usage.

This project uses a decentralized flow control algorithm to move the control strategy to  decentralized clients, 
the goal is to reduce the dependence on the network. 
the control algorithm of this project requires the request flow to meet the following requirements in most of the time:
* In a short time (<10s), the overall traffic flow of the cluster is stable.
* In a short time (<10s), the traffic flow of each node in the cluster is stable.
     
The algorithm of this project is also sensitive to traffic changes in the flow over a certain interval (>10s), and can dynamically calculate and adapt to changes.

In scenarios where the traffic flow is often non-continuous or has many of instantaneous burst, the algorithm of this project may not work well.

## Supported flow limiter interface
The minimum flow control interval that can be set by the flow limiter of this project is the interval at which the client node performs global data synchronization (generally 2s~10s). 

For the scenario of service flow protection limitation, the total number of passes per minute (or more) can be set. During this time period, the smooth release of traffic can be achieved. 

For scenarios such as budget control and experimental diversion, the start and end time of the task can be set. During this task period, the smooth release of traffic can be achieved too.

The flow limiter of this project can set the downstream conversion reward as the target to control the request's passing. 
For example, by controlling the number of advertisements cast(passed), the goal of ad clicks (reward) can be achieved finally. 
The target reward volume and the traffic pass volume should be positively correlated, otherwise the flow controller of this project may not be able to achieve control.

The flow limiter of this project provides hierarchical flow limiter. If the requested traffic carries score value information, 
the hierarchical flow limiter of this project can automatically pass traffic with a higher score to achieve the goal of traffic hierarchical selection. 
Traffic classification selection to prioritize high-value traffic is a weapon to maximize system value.

## Principles of the limiter's algorithm
The flow control calculation algorithm of this project re-evaluates the flow situation in a fixed period (about 2s~10s), and adapt to changes in traffic through parameter adjustment.

#### Estimate current cluster's traffic volume by local traffic volume
The flow control algorithm of this project believes that the cluster traffic and local traffic are stable for a short time, 
so the proportion of local traffic in the cluster traffic is also stable for a short time.

The dynamic update algorithm of LocalTrafficProportion is as follows:
    
    LocalTrafficProportion : = LocalTrafficProportion * P + (RecentLocalRequest/RecentClusterRequest) * (1-P)
    
   >Note: P stands for attenuation coefficient, used to control smoothness.

Formula for estimating current cluster traffic:

    CurrentClusterTraffic: = LastSynchronizedClusterTraffic + LocalRequestSinceSynchronized/LocalTrafficProportion
    
    
#### Calculate the current conversion ratio from pass volume to reward volume
Since the flow limiter does not directly control the reward volume, 
the conversion ratio needs to be calculated to calculate the pass volume to achieve the target reward volume. 

Update ConversionRate formula:
    ConversionRatio: = ConversionRatio * P + (RewardRecently / PassRecently) * (1 â€“ P)

#### Calculate the limiter's ideal pass rate
The flow controller of this project is controlled by the proportional parameter (passRate). 

The formula for calculating the IdealPassingRate is as follows:

    IdealPassRate : = IdealPassRate * P + ((RewardRecently/RequestRecently)/RewardRate) * (1-P)
    
#### Adjust the working pass rate of the limiter
The IdealPassRate has a certain lag, and the working pass rate needs to be adjusted according to the actual conversion situation.

If the current actual reward volume is less than the smoothed ideal reward volume, 
the calculation formula of the WorkingPassRate:

    WorkingPassRate: = WorkingPassRate * (1 + LagTime/AccelerationPeriod)
 
If the current actual reward volume is greater than the smoothed ideal reward volume. 

The calculation formula of the WorkingPassRate is as follows:

    WorkingPassRate: = IdealPassRate * (1 - ExcessTime/AccelerationPeriod)
